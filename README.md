Nothing like coding a game to solidify its bases in OOP! We are therefore going to create a game of noughts and crosses, a highly strategic game that is insanely exciting if there is one.

For those who did not go through the noughts and crosses in their childhood (or their adolescence for the less hygienic), we specify 8 behaviors expected from the program (in order of importance) :

The game can only be played with two human players (we are not asking you to code artificial intelligence todayâ€¦);
The program should start by asking for the first name of each player;
The game board is made up of 9 squares, each designated by its vertical position (A, B or C) followed by its horizontal position (1, 2 or 3). Examples: the box at the top right is called "A3" and the one at the bottom right "C3";
At the start of each game turn, the program displays the game board in the terminal. Then it asks the player whose turn it is to play;
Players take turns playing until one of them wins or the game board is full;
The program should detect the end of the game. If a player wins, the game announces his name. If there is a draw, the program must inform both players;
At the end of a game, the program must offer to start a new game;
An effort will have to be made on the display of the game in the terminal (eg: board displayed in a stylish way, game counter, colors, etc.).
